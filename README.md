# PotProject
Our project is to uncover patterns in criminal activity, unemployment rate, road safety, opioid abuse, and school finances in Colorado, Washington (state), Arizona, and Florida. We'll examine relationships between these topics and each state's stance on the legalization of recreational marijuana; as well as related questions, as the data permits.
